# Welcome to "Today I learned" React App

This app is created along with the [Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/ "A quick, fun, and hands-on introduction to web development. Build a complete app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React!") course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ "jonas.io"). Make sure to checkout his amazing contents.

In this app which it's database is made by [Supabass](https://supabase.com/ "an open source Firebase alternative"), you can add what ever facts you recently learned in different categories. The list of facts can be filtered and each fact has three voting emoji. If the ‚õî emoji was more that the sum of üëç and ü§Ø, that fact become a DISPUTED fact indicating that the fact might not be true.

## Release Versions

The [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/ashkheid/today-i-learned/releases/tag/v1.0.0) is exactly what I had just after I finished the course. In future I might update the code quality and add some features to this app.
